They are not sure what the response will be so they are going to trial a new system on a small set of their data. </p>\n<p>The library database has a table <code>articles</code> with a record of all articles published in the newspaper. However, the table will need some preparation before the library can use it in the new system. They would like to focus the initial trial on articles from 2014 and 2015 only, and for just one journalist whose ID in the database is 1754.</p>\n<p>The final results should be sorted from earliest published date to the most recent published date.</p>\n<p>Below are the requirements the library has given to you for the data they need. </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left;\">Requirements</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left;\">Data Type</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left;\">Column Alias</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left;\">Unique ID of each article, where the first 4 digits represents the journalist ID.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left;\">TEXT</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left;\">article_key</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left;\">Category of the article, in uppercase.
