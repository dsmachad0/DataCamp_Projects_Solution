DATACAMP GUIDED PROJECT ON PostgreSQL

This is my solution, using PostgreSQL, in a guided project on the DataCamp platform. 
In this project, I queried the World Bank's international debt dataset to analyze international debts statistics and answer the following questions:

•	What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
•	Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
•	What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
